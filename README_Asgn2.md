In our game there are two birds that are fighting against each other to try to assemble a computer as fast as they can because they want to become programmers. The multiplayer aspect is the fact that you are competing against another player to assemble the computer in your correct zone as fast as possible. The components are scattered throughout the field. Therefore, it fits the birds and computer theme, we aptly named our game Nerd Bird. 

Some unusual rules we want to implement are that the game can have other pieces beyond just the computer. By getting one of these pieces the player will either get a boost to their speed. Our game is 3-D in terms of the shapes and the players themselves. 

• Players - The two birds <br/>  		
• Objectives - Each player wants to assemble their computer as fast as possible so they can be the ultimate bird programmer<br/>
• Procedures - The birds can move by flying to the pieces of the computer and then move them into their zones. The scores of each piece for each person will be updated on their zone when it gets there. W, A, S, D are used to control the bird's angle. The right and left arrows turn the bird, and the up and down arrows move the bird forwards and backwards.<br/>
• Rules - Birds can only move one piece at a time. Fastest one to build the computer wins. The components don’t disappear and are reusable, so the other player can take them from their opponent. However, this does not cause the player to lose points. <br/>
• Resources - We have two types of pieces, computer and abilities. Computer pieces are collected to win the game. Abilities pieces are used to boost your powers and disappear when collected.<br/>
• Conflict - There can only be one bird programmers- it’s a highly sought after job and therefore they are both fighting to get it. <br/>
• Boundaries - Physical edges of the board are the boundaries. They are a hard boundary that the bird can’t get past. There’s no fly zones in this world too unfortunately. <br/>
• Outcome - One player gets their dream of being the best programmer, the other will (probably) ask for a rematch because they lost. <br/>
